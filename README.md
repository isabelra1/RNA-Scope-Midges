# RNA-Scope-Midges

**Abstract**: 

Bluetongue virus (BTV) is a double-stranded RNA virus with a segmented genome that can cause devastating infections in ruminants. The Culicoides biting midge is the vector culpable for BTV transmission. As a virus with a segmented genome, there is limited understanding of BTV dissemination and cellular coinfection within the midge vector. This knowledge would augment understanding of BTV transmission dynamics and viral evolution via reassortment. Thus, the aim of this project is to investigate and compare BTV progression through insect dissemination barriers in midges that are infected with a single BTV serotype or coinfected with two different BTV serotypes. It is predicted that coinfection will result in accelerated dissemination compared to single infection. Pools of colony Culicoides sonorensis midges were harvested at prescribed timepoints after blood feeding. In situ hybridization was performed on histology slides prepared for each midge treatment group using the 4-plex fluorescent RNAscope platform to detect BTV-10 (segment 2 and 10) and BTV-17 (segment 2 and 10). Resulting confocal images were analyzed for cellular coinfection and dissemination patterns. Current results indicate dissemination in coinfected midges beyond the midgut escape barrier consistently by 4 days post infection. Understanding how BTV coinfection may affect transmission dynamics and evolution will add an important facet to modeling and mitigation strategies for this virus of high consequence.

**Working with OlyVIA**:

Through many trials and errors we found a way to navigate OlyVIA and worked with the settings to best view the channel colors without alterating the actual results. When opening an image with OlyVIA it was easiest for us to hit the default botton in the histogram settings. This allowed us to see all the midges clearly and at least understand their layout. Afterwards, we would go into the distinct settings for each channel. Unfortunately, OlyVIA does not allow you to edit multiple channel settings at once. It was a bit of a manual process, but essentially you would have to make sure only one channel was on when editing that channels settings. Here were the histogram settings that worked best for our images:

DAPi: 10,000 - 40,000

FitC: 10,000 - 40,000

Cy3: 15,000 - 40,000

Cy5: 0 - 20,000

Cy7: 20,000 - 60,000

If you look under the file OlyVIA Guides you can find two PDFs that helped us work with OlyVIA!

**Classifying Viral Presence**:

In general, we would individually look at each channel and see if there was any presence in the following locations within the midge body: Midgut, Body Cavity, Salivary Gland, Head, Brain, Ommatidia, Lens. We would also note any overlap between where the channels were lighting up. There are limitations with this such as some midges missing their heads, differentiating ommatidia and lens, and differences depending on who is analyzing the images.
